# The root
Straight forward challenge, we simply had to invoke the program using its absolute path which is already provided.
# Program and absolute paths
Another easy challenge, just like last time the whole path to a program is provided and you simply have to type it in the terminal.
# Position thy self
This challenge involved first running the "run" program after which, it provided the directory you needed to cd into then run the program again for the flag.
# Position else where
Same as the last challenge
# Position yet elsewhere
Same as last 2 challenges
# Implicit relative paths
This challenges aims to make us use relative paths i.e simply cd into the / directory then directly mention the challenge/run.
# Explicit relative paths
This challenges makes us use ./ to teach you can add ./ in various positions in a relative path and it still remains the same, a simple challenge.
# implicit relative path
A program cant be run be calling its name directly in a directory so using information from last challenge when we cd into /challenge and then use ./run to solve it.
# home sweet home
This challenge took me a few minutes to do because I was not able to figure out how to pass an argument to the run the program, other than that it involved simply using ~ and creating a single letter file inside it to unlock the flag.
