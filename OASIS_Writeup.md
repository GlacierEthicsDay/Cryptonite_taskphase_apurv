# A rocky start -
This challenge gave us a unity game file, the challenge description said "sometimes you need to overflow the memory", which gave a clear hint that we need to buffer overflow to get this challenge flag. On running the game there is a field which asks for your name and then the game starts with the objective being to score over hundred, using a short name showed a score of zero before the the game crashed, so I tried using a longer name and saw the score increased, with a extremely long name the score was again zero so it had to be sufficiently long but not too long and occupy space in memory too so I used abc123 and special characters, brackets etc combinations in various ways until I reached the score of over 100 and then got the flag.
# All that for a drop of blood
In this challenge, we arrived on a page with text that said start game, below that in hidden component there was text saying "answer my questions to win", pressing start game gave us response that you must be OASISPlayer to play. After this I tried looking into the cookies and headers but didnt see anything interesting, I looked at the hint for the event that said "Sometimes you need to have the Head of an Agent to become what you want to", this made it obvious we had to change the user-agent header to "OASISPlayer", after this we got a question in the response and we had to append the answer to endpoint of the url and send a new request, we repeat this a few times until we answer the final question and finally get the flag.
# Heads up tails down
This challenge provided a corrupted png file, when opening it using a meta data reader and converting the raw header, it said "fixme_to_crackme", so it this involved fixing the png file hex so we can see the png file, I simply searched for png file hex structure and used python code to edit the hex data of this corrupted file to its correct state which revealed a png image that was drawn by hand in a photo editor application which revealed the flag.
# I have been falling for 30 minutes
This challenge had a website with flames as the background and showed different types of users when you clicked next on the page and their logged in time, my first attempt was trying to see if the fetched background image contained anything interesting but that went nowhere, then I looked at requests made by the page and if there are any interesting cookies both of which did not turn up with anything useful, I then noticed the url had a user=id value in it which changed from 0 to 5 as we changed pages so I tried using user=6, and this revealed the admin page user which contained the flag.
# Stairway to heaven
This challenge gave us a file called game, I checked the extension for it and saw its a 64 bit ELF executable file, So my intial approach was going towards reverse engineering route since this was a ELF file and description of the challenge mentioned tetris so this might be a step by step function reversing challenge, I opened the file with ghidra and explored it for a while and didnt get anything conclusive, so I tried running it once to see what output do we get, the output returned a series of coloured blocks which did seem similar to a tetris game, I tried to copy this output and paste in a cipher identifier to see if it matches something, when I realised all of this is a text, I pasted it in a text file and saw the output was infact all text, I tried searching OASIS and FLAG through it and flag matched a string, then we simply had to convert the ASCII decimal encoding to text to get the flag.
